In order to ensure system availability, we have developed a maintenance policy for the FRMA Ontology. All changes to the ontology should be submitted as a pull request on the https://github.com/FRMA-Ontology/Ontology GitHub, with documentation explaining what the change is and why it should be changed. FRMA team members will review the pull request and merge the changes if the requests contain merit and are in line with the FRMA use case. New versions along with all legacy version will be made available on the project website and all documentation will be kept up to date. A strict hierarchy for changes will be enforced with the following order, any changes made to artifacts higher in the hierarchy the change will cascade to all lower artifacts:

- Use Case
- Ontologies
- Concept Map
- LFW Scripts
- SPARQL queries
