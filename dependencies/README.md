# Dependencies

These ontologies are dependencies for the FRMA ontology. We have encountered many problems doing local development of our modularized ontology with Protege - specifically, the software seems to have problems correctly resolving remote dependencies. We're maintaining local copies of these ontologies here because Protege works inconsistently without them.
